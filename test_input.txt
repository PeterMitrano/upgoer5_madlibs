We used a recurrent neural network as a fitness function for
a genetic algorithm to generate monophonic solos. The genetic algorithm is based on GenJam as described in Biles.
We conducted training sessions with human participants in order to compare and quantify some of the differences between human-feedback and RNN fitness functions.
We found that the RNNs can effectively play the role of human fitness feedback, but still suffer in many areas. Our results suggest that certain types of recurrent neural networks
can address the issues with human feedback, and thus should
be explored in future research.
There have been many approaches to automatic composition
that combine AI techniques. Often these systems contain a
generative component and an optimizing component. Techniques for the generative component include genetic algorithms, feed-forward neural networks,
and grammars. The optimizing component could be gradient descent for neural network generators, more
genetic algorithms, human input, or variable neighborhood search .
